<p>Minesweeper is a simple-player puzzle video game developed by Robert Donner in 1989. The game consists in a n x m of grid-covered squares when the player must explore through a square revealing either a mine or an integer. This integer represents the number of mines adjacent to that clicked square. The game ends when the player probes a cell containing a mine, and the goal is to prove all uncovered squares that do not contain a mine. Minesweeper allows the player to marl with a flag the position of the possible mine, but thegame does not validate any flagged square, for this reason, higher levels of Minesweeper involve agreater degree of deductive reasoning: the number of mines increases. Exists three levels in the game: beginning, intermediate, and expert. The beginning has a total of 10 mines and the board size is either 8 x 8,9 x 9, or 10 x 10. Intermediate has 40 mines and also varies in size between 13 x 15 and 16 x 16. Finally expert with 99 mines and sizes of 16 x 30 or 30 x 16
